# Python_Projects
A collection of small side projects done to practice Python coding.
One of these projects is a game of tic tac toe, which I am still working on completing. My end goal is to have an unbeatable opponent.
The other project was part of my learning of sockets and JSON notation. By using Google Map's API, I wanted to return a comma separated list of all the locations in Tennessee that show up when you search the numbers 1-1000.
I will be adding more to this collection as I continue to grow in my Python competency.
